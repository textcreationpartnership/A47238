            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Wherefore Oathes of State were contrived thereby to entrap the Orthodoxal Christians; the Masse, Sacrifices, Rights, and Ecclesiasticall Ceremonies were abolished, and in their place the <hi>Arian</hi> forme for Common prayer was set
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102387:6"/> up. Disputations were offered to the Catholick Bishops, but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently and uncivilly demeaned. The Bishops were driven from their Sees, the Clergy exiled, and a new race of Bishops, and Priests put in their places. Senators were removed from the Senate, and thrust out of their dwelling mansions. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick people were not suffered to beare Offices, but were confined, restrained, and forbidden to be harboured, or relieved. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

These barbarous and inhumane persecutions of the Vandall Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have bin detested in all after times, and I much feare that some Machiavellians in our, and our fathers memories have fetcht their projects, plots, &amp; machinations in their intended overthrow of all Religion from these uncircumcised Barbarians.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102387:7"/> enact such penalties for those who refused to heare the same: Nor can it be answered that the Parliament ordaining the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer booke to be used, and sayd in all Churches through the Kingdome, bestowed goodnesse on the booke, and made it holy: So likewise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Parliament declaring the same booke to be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious and damnable, makes it to be so indeed. For as in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Faith there is an intrinsecall, and constant verity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can Counsells make them by their Declarations, Articles of our beliefe, but onely that such and such positions were either immediately revealed, or are by necessary consequence deduced out of Principles revealed. Nor is it in the power of Synods by any Declarations whatsoever, to make what is false true, or what is true false: So likewise in morall Actions, such as the Worship of God, belonging to Religion (a morrall Virtue) there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent dignity and goodnesse conforme and acceptable to the will of God unalterable by any Parliament, or constitutions of men. And though Parliaments may presume to ordaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand such Religious Service to be practised, and used in a Kingdome, and following Parliaments take upon them to annull, abrogate, and abolish the said Religious Acts, and forme of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ordained, and established by their Predecessors▪ Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all such Ordinances, Declarations, and injunctions, the said forme of Common prayer is neither better nor worse in its owne nature, that is either in conformity to the will of God, or obliquity, and repugnance to the sayd divine will; but if once pleasing and holy, it is still and ever will be so: If superstitious and bad, it was ever so, and will alwayes so remaine. I meane in this last state of grace, when by our Saviours fullfilling the Law, the Sacrifices, Sacraments, Rites, and Ceremonies of <hi>Moses</hi> were evacuated: Nor may wee expect new Law-givers, or new Revelations in substantiall points of beliefe and divine worship. Wherefore as if because at some times of the day, namely mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening, my body casts a larger shadow then at other houres of the same day, to wit about noone (without the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction or extension of my stature &amp; dimensions) I should be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a foole or a madman, if looking on my shaddow I would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory in my height at one time, or be dejected seeing my selfe represented a Dwarfe at another; the shaddow neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

In like manner it were a great want of judgement to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that any Commonwealth or Senate Representative of that Commonwealth, can with the shadow of their Ordinances, and Declarations adde to, or take from the worth and dignity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Liturgy, or Common prayer booke, if it be good and holy, or the obliquity, if damnable and superstitious: Wherefore such, who sit at the helme of States, ought with much caution and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration be carefull what they impose on the people in this kinde, and with the like warinesse be advised how they abolish the same once commanded, and by publick Authority established. There hapned in Michaelmas Tearme, 1647. an odde passage at the Sessions of Newgate, where a Gentleman pleading for his life in danger by the severity of our Lawes (in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) told the Recorder that for many yeares the Recusants were persecuted, imprisoned, and forced to pay large summes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, because they could not so far stretch their consciences as to go to heare such prayers, which were now condemned as dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and superstitious, and he adjoyned that by this Declaration and condemnation, the Parliament had done the Recusants much right in manifesting to the world why they lost their goods, were imprisoned, and suffered death, namely, because they did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It never was a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tenent of the Church that Hereticks, though convicted, yea relapsed, and most obstinate, might be punished with death, if there were no danger of Sedition and Rebellion against the Commonwealth. And concerning the practice of the Inquisition, it is certaine that very many Catholicks, and extraordinary learned have disallowed that practice, though this is a businesse of fact▪ or rather prudence, and discretion▪ not of Doctrine.</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> likewise much commendeth those Imperiall Lawes which punished Hereticks, but not with death.

Neither is there any constant perseverance to be expected in such convertites; for ordinarily they change and shift their Religions as often as Players doe their clothes. And for my part I confesse, I could never meete with a solid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why heere in England there should be such mutuall enmity, hatred, bitternesse, and persecutions for diversity of opinions in Religion, since Protestant, Puritan, Brownist, Anabaptist, and the rest agree in Fundamentall Points of Faith.</p>

But (you will say) their Wives were turned out of doores at midnight.
